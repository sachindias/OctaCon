## Concept
The basic concept behind OctaCon is to convert text and pictures to music using octal (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal). 
This is particularly beneficial for music as octal is a base-8 numerical system and many scales have 8 notes (from root note to octave). 

As the exact implementation is different for converting text to music (TextaCon) and converting pictures to music (PictaCon) we will run through these separately below. 
The main difference concerns how we get from text or pictures to octal in the first place.
